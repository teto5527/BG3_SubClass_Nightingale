Unbound by the weight of armor, their steps are light, their strikes foretold by fate. They cloaking themselves in shadow, where their arrows glide like the silent winds of night, claiming the lives of those who drift into their sights. Few know where the Nightingales come from, and even fewer sense their presenceâ€”until the final breath fades into the darkness. They are the emissaries of the night, graceful yet deadly.</content>
